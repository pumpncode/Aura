# Aura
Aura is a mod that seeks to add animations to every Joker in Balatro.

**40/150** Jokers completed, 5 of which are work in progress

Known Bugs:
- Pixel Smoothing causes the border in Castle and clubs in Seeing Double to look wonky
- Rerolling while having a duplicated Flash Card (via Invisible Joker/Ankh) will crash the game
- Some animated jokers will have frames flash when they spawn (Flash Card, will find more maybe later)
- Crashes when opening [Malverk](https://github.com/Eremel/Malverk) settings
  - May animate cards improperly/which shouldn't animate with Malverk

Artists and progress for each Joker are detailed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/174gWOyMyTUSuESsiqWSt5OYEr8mcDdAM2Ig9oDxMTlQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
